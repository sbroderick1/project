    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><h2>What is your website about?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>For my webpage I want to create a fashion blog focusing on
                    trends, fashion icons/influencers, current events, comparing 
                    runway vs ready-to-wear, and one page with my favorite trends
                    and vision as a designer. My hope was to have this be a boutique
                    webstite and be able to sell my own deigns. However, since I dont
                    have the designs yet that might be something I have to add later 
                    down the road after this class.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>What is the objective of your website?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>the objective of my website is to educate people about all areas of
                    the fashion indsustry as well as establish myself and my views as an 
                    up and coming designer to all the people looking at my website. Then 
                    long term the objective for my website will be to sell my own designs.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>Who is your target audience set?</h2>
            <ul>

                    are insterested in staying up to date with influencers, trends, current 
                    events, etc. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I plan to have a homepage that will be the landing page of the 
                    site and have all the pages available to click on. The homepage 
                    styling will also clearly represent my aesthetic as a designer. For 
                    other pages there will be an "About Me" that explains how I became
                    passionate about sewing and fashoin, my experience in the industry 
                    and my goals for the future. As instructed there will be a customer/feedback 
                    page so I can interact with my viewers. For the content I want to have a blog 
                    style page for each category so trends, fashion icons/influencers, current 
                    events in fashion, runway vs ready to wear, and a personal page with my 
                    favorites. I would like to add a page for selling my own designs and 
                    garments as well to e developed in the future one my line is fully 
                    complete and produced.
