      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h3>Style/Aesthetic:</h3>
      <p>I am a designer whose main goal is to make women feel confident, sexy and beautiful. My aesthetic is classic and simple but with 
          some edge or unique design element. I gravtiate towards luxurious fabrics and colors over vibrant patterns as I prefer the style
          of the garment to be the statement not the fabric. In terms of designing, I have been focusing on bringing lucury to loungewear for 
          my first fashion line. I think this would be the perfect line to launch my brand. 
      </p>
      <h3>Experience in the Fashion Industry</h3>
      <p>I began to take my passion for fashion design seriously in high school. My junior and senior year I worked on an indpendent study 
          where I developed a 12 piece collectiom that was displayed in our schools art showcase. I wa able to showcase my full development
          process including inspiration, sketches, fabric selection, product construction, fittings, alterations, and photoshoot. Since then 
          I have continued to sketch and contruct garments in any free time that I have as a full time student-athlete. I have interned at a local
          boutique in Wellesley, MA called Anna Nieman Couture as a marketing and design intern where I was able to assist the designer with
          sourcing fabric, client consultations, increasing exposure, gainig market share, and updating the website and social media plaforms.
          I have also showcased my designs in a school fashion show. I have been offered a merchandising position at TJX for after graduation
          which I have excepted and am excited for role in maintaining the sucess of the company.  
      </p>
      <h3>Aspirations</h3>
      <p>As a rising senior at Babson College, I am getting my Bachelors Degree in General Business Administration with a concentration
          in Retail Supply Chain Management. After graudation I was offered an entry level job as an allocation analyst at TJX Companies.
          My hope is to begin my career at TJX, a well established and large company, to gain lots of real world exposure, gain my footing
          in the industry and learn all the inner workings of how to run a successful fashion business. As you will see below I have been
          designing clothes since high school. Since my return from my semester abroad in Milan, I have been working on the development 
          and launch of my fashion line. This fashion line will be a true representation of my aesthetic and vision as a designer. This 
          is a very large project and of course will take time. I plan to work on this for the first few years afer graduation as a side 
          job. I will be working at TJX during the day and in my own time working to grow my fashion line into a successful and strongly
          desired company. My hope is that one day I can have my own company and be a designer/entrepreneur/business woman/style icon.
